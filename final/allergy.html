          <h2> Food Allergies </h2>

          <p> Did you know that the most commonly reported allergies for cats and dogs are chicken, beef, dairy, and eggs (and fish for cats)? </p>

          <p>
            August has very serve allergic reactions, mostly skin inflammations and sometimes stomach issues, to many proteins. So far, we have discovered that she's allergic to chicken, turkey, and salmon. However,  there are some other allergens we haven't figured out.  Therefore, her diet is strictly sticking to a single-protein diet.
